<h1>Excel Reader</h1>

This application is a part of the www.thecsharpacademy.com roadmap.<br>
Goal of the website is to become a (better) C# and .Net developper.<br>
<br>
<h2>About the project:</h2>
This application reads an Excel file, then adds the content to a database. The database then gets printed to console.<br>
I used some sample Excel file about employees that I found on the internet. Originaly it consisted out of more than 1000 records but I've narrowed it a down to 50 for better readability.
<br>
<h2>Requirements:</h2>
- Read data from an Excel file into a database.<br>
- When the application runs, the database should be deleted if it already exists and then be (re)created.<br>
- Make use of SQL or SQLite.<br>
- Once the database is populated, print the content of it to console.<br>
- No userinput is needed.<br>
<br>
<h2>Lessons learned:</h2>
- How to read and create a Excel file with EPPlus.<br>
- The rest was pretty straight forward.<br>
<br>
<h2>Resources used:</h2>
- The documentation at the assignment page and the discord channel of www.thecsharpacademy.com .<br>
- Youtube video from Tim Corey on how to use EPPlus.<br>
- Some free Excel data sample file from thespreadsheetguru.com .<br>
